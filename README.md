# FF8-Utilities
A program designed to collate all the manipulation used into one easy to use program that doesn't require Ruby or command shell knowledge

The UI is written in WPF, utilising MAHApps Metro for a slick ui.
Manipulations are broken up into separate projects.  Currently the Zell Card Manip is a WIP and is not utilised (instead links to pingval script)
